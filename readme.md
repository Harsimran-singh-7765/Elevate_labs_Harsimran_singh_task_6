# KNN Classification Task

## Objective:
Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using the Iris dataset.

## Tools:
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

## What We Did:
- Loaded and normalized the dataset  
- Trained KNN model with different K values  
- Plotted Accuracy vs K graph  
- Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning  
- Visualized decision boundaries  

## How to Run:
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
- Run `main.ipynb` notebook step by step  

## Output:
- Found best K value using GridSearchCV  
- Improved model accuracy  
- Visualized decision regions
